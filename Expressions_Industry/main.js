//I build a website's homepage. The width is 1900px and height is 6000px.
//I would like to fill the background with a picture I like. The picture's width is 100px and height is 200px.
//How many pictures can I put in this homepage?

//How big is the homepage?
//What is the width of the homepage?

var widthPage = prompt ("What is the width of the homepage?");

//What is the height of the homepage?

var heightPage = prompt ("What is the height of the homepage?");

//What is the area of the homepage?

var areaPage = heightPage*widthPage;

console.log("Since width of the homepage is "+widthPage+"px and the height of it is "+heightPage+"px, the area of this homepage is "+areaPage+"px.");
